Static Godocs
=============

Until the actual library implementation is merged, this directory will contain
static godocs generated with [`doc2go`](https://abhinav.github.io/doc2go/) and 
served via `make godoc`. When the library code is merged, this contents of this 
folder will be removed and the documentation served via the actual `godoc` 
binary.
